#Overview

Welcome to the Object Recognition and Localization project! This project uses a pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with a ResNet50 backbone to recognize and classify objects in images. It predicts bounding boxes around detected objects, and we use the Pascal VOC dataset for training and evaluation.

#Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

#Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Download and Extract Dataset:**
   ```
   python download_and_extract.py
   Explore the Dataset:
(Optional) Open explore_dataset.ipynb to understand the dataset structure.

2.Preprocess the Dataset:
python preprocess_data.py

3.Build the Model:
The model architecture is in build_model.py.

4.Compile and Train the Model:
python train_model.py

5.Evaluate the Model:
python evaluate_model.py

6.Hyperparameter Tuning:
Adjust hyperparameters in train_model.py for optimal performance.


This README provides a concise and user-friendly guide to set up, run, and understand the project
